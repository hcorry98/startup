## The Start Up Application for CS 260

This is my public repository for the start up application for CS 260.

I'm excited to learn more about web programming.

I learned how to resolve merge conflicts and what the default pull options are when a conflict exists. I also learned the process of editing, committing, pushing, and pulling.
