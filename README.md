This is my public repository for the start up application for CS 260.

I'm excited to learn more about web programming.

I learned how to resolve merge conflicts and what the default pull options are when a conflict exists. I also learned the process of editing, committing, pushing, and pulling.

### Delligator

I’ve come up with this app that allows teams to divide tasks to more easily manage a project. It’s called “Delligator”. We can set up a project on there and then assign tasks, or parts of the project, to each member in the group. That way we know exactly what portions of the group project we’re each in charge of, and we can see in real-time where everyone is at with their responsibilities. It’ll help increase productivity and avoid confusion as to who is in charge of what. It will also help improve and ease communication about the progress of our project.

The mascot and logo for the app is an alligator named Del.
